*About Me*

Hey there! 👋 I’m Danish Veer Rana, a passionate tech enthusiast 💻 and photographer 📸 from the beautiful mountains of Patnitop, J&K, India. I’m currently an 11th-grade student studying PCM with Computer Science, and I’m on an exciting journey to blend technology and creativity! 🚀

I absolutely love coding 🖥️! Whether it's building apps, experimenting with machine learning 🤖, or creating voice-controlled systems, I'm always diving into new tech to create solutions that can make a real impact. My focus is on crafting efficient, intuitive, and innovative projects that solve real-world problems. 💡

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me behind the camera, capturing the world around me through photography. 📷 It’s a hobby that lets me express my creativity and appreciate the small moments in life. I believe both tech and photography are amazing tools for storytelling, and I try to combine them in my projects whenever possible. ✨

On my GitHub and portfolio, you’ll find a mix of exciting projects, from cutting-edge software to creative tools and apps. I showcase my best work in my portfolio, where you can explore my journey and see how I merge my skills in tech and photography. 🌍

Take a look around, and feel free to connect if you want to collaborate or chat about tech and photography! 🔥
