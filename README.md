## Hey, Welcome to My GitHub! 🚀

Hi there! I’m Danish Veer Rana, a tech enthusiast 💻 and photographer 📸 from the beautiful hills of J&K, India. I’m currently in 11th grade, diving deep into PCM with Computer Science and building awesome projects! 🎉

I’m all about blending technology and creativity to build solutions that solve real problems and make life easier. Whether it’s creating innovative apps, experimenting with machine learning 🤖, or developing voice-controlled systems, I’m always excited to explore new ways to innovate.

But wait, there’s more! When I’m not coding, I’m behind the camera, capturing the beauty of the world around me through photography. 📷 I believe in telling stories through both code and the lens, which is why you’ll find a mix of tech and creative projects on my profile.
